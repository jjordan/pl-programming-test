- Programming Exercise

Write a program that will help automate code reviews of pull requests to our GitHub repositories. We are command line people, so this should be a command line application, but you can write it in whatever language and using whatever libraries you think are best. Show us the way that you think software should be written. The minimum that we expect is that it will work.

Using the GitHub api (documented at https://api.github.com/) write a program that will scan the currently open pull requests for a specified project and reports whether or not the open pull request contain “interesting items”, which will be explained below. 

** Bonus points if the report also contains which “interesting item(s)” showed up and where. **

The Interesting Items:

Does not contain changes to any files in the “spec/” directory
Any added or deleted lines contain the follow words (not as substrings of larger words):
/dev/null
raise
.write
%x
exec
Any change to the files
Gemfile
.gemspec
Example
> review puppetlabs/puppet
https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/16663 - Interesting
https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/16600 - Not Interesting
https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/16598 - Not Interesting

Please email me and include a link to a Github repository with your solution, or a link to an archive we can download that has your code in it.
